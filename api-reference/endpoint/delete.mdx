title: 'Delete Post'
openapi: 'DELETE /posts/{id}'
---

Overview

- Deletes a post by id. JSONPlaceholder simulates deletion and returns a success status without persisting.

Path parameter
- id (number): The post id to delete.

Example usage

```api
- name: Delete post 1
  method: DELETE
  path: /posts/1
```

Response notes
- Status 200: JSONPlaceholder typically returns an empty object or success.
- Data is not actually removed from subsequent GET responses on /posts.

Tips
- Use after creating a post to show lifecycle, then GET to show read-only nature of the dataset.
