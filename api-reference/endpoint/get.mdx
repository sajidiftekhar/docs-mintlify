Overview

- No authentication required; perfect for demos of Mintlify Try it out.

When to use
- Fetch sample content items for demos, prototypes, or to test API flows.

Query parameters
- _limit (number): Optional. Maximum number of posts to return (1-100). Useful to keep responses short in demos.

Example usage

```api
- name: List first 5 posts
  method: GET
  path: /posts
  query:
    _limit: 5
  headers:
    Accept: application/json
```

Response notes
- Status 200: An array of Post objects with fields id, userId, title, and body.
- JSONPlaceholder returns static seeded data; repeated calls return the same list unless filtered.

Tips
- Combine with /comments?postId={id} to show relationships.
- Use _limit to keep responses compact for readers.
