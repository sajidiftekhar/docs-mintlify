title: 'Create Post'
openapi: 'POST /posts'
---

Overview

- Creates a new post. JSONPlaceholder fakes creation and responds with a new id.
- Great for demonstrating request bodies, validation, and response handling without needing a backend.

Request body
- userId (number, required): The author id.
- title  (string, required): Title for the post.
- body   (string, required): The content.

Example usage

```api
- name: Create a post
  method: POST
  path: /posts
  headers:
    Content-Type: application/json
  body:
    json:
      userId: 1
      title: "Hello Mintlify"
      body: "This is a demo post created from the API playground."
```

Response notes
- Status 201: Returns the post object with a generated id.
- JSONPlaceholder does not persist data; subsequent GETs wonâ€™t include this post.

Tips
- Use this alongside GET /posts to illustrate the difference between mocked creation and read-only data.
