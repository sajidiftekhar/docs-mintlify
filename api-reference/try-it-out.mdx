<Note>
  This page showcases Mintlify's interactive API playground wired to JSONPlaceholder.
  No authentication is required. You can modify inputs and send real requests live.
</Note>

## Live requests (from OpenAPI)

The blocks below use the base URL https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com from the OpenAPI spec.

```api
- name: List posts (limit 3)
  method: GET
  path: /posts
  query:
    _limit: 3
  headers:
    Accept: application/json

- name: Get a post by id
  method: GET
  path: /posts/1
  headers:
    Accept: application/json

- name: Create a post
  method: POST
  path: /posts
  headers:
    Content-Type: application/json
  body:
    json:
      userId: 1
      title: "Using Mintlify Try it out"
      body: "Created from the live playground."

- name: List comments for a post
  method: GET
  path: /comments
  query:
    postId: 1
```

## What this demo covers

- How to connect an OpenAPI spec and let pages auto-resolve endpoints via frontmatter.
- How to use inline request blocks to run live calls without code.
- How to document behaviors (mocked creation, read-only dataset, query params, path params).
